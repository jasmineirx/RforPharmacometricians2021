# Overview

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning 
and preparing the data. (Dasu and Johnson, 2003)

Thus before you can even get to doing any sort of sophisticated analysis or 
plotting, you'll generally first need to do some of the following tasks:

1. ***Manipulating*** data frames, e.g., filtering, summarizing, and conducting 
   calculations across groups.
2. ***Tidying*** data into the appropriate format

There are two competing schools of thought within the R community.

* We should stick to the base R functions to do manipulating and tidying; 
  `tidyverse` uses syntax that's unlike base R and is superfluous.
* We should start teaching students to manipulate data using `tidyverse` tools 
  because they are straightfoward to use, more readable than base R, and speed 
  up the tidying process.

I'll introduce you to the `tidyverse` tools. If your R tasks are data analysis, 
graphing, modeling and statistics, you can accomplish most of what you need 
using the tidyverse. Tidyverse also often has helpful error messages.

My own view: I use both base R and tidyverse, but will prefer tidyverse if I 
need to do more than ~3 operations on a dataset. The tidyverse is a major reason 
why R is so popular for data analysis, and many people that mainly working in 
python will sometimes switch to R just for data cleaning & graphing. 

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for 
data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and 
data structures. 

# Data frame Manipulation using `dplyr`

The [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) package 
provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating data frames. 
Code written with `dplyr` is often easier to read than code written in "base R".

We're going to learn how to subset data frames: how do we *filter* for the rows 
we want? How do we *select* the columns we want?

```{r}
# If you haven't yet installed dplyr, install it now!
# install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)

# Lets also load the gap data set:
gap <- read.csv(
  file.path("..", "data", "gapminder-FiveYearData.csv"), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

head(gap)
```

## `dplyr::select`

Imagine that we just received the gapminder dataset, but are only interested in 
a few variables in it. We could use the `select()` function to keep only the 
columns corresponding to variables we select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp_dplyr <- select(gap, year, country, gdpPercap)
head(year_country_gdp_dplyr)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "img", "dplyr-fig1.png"), dpi = 400)
```

If we open up `year_country_gdp`, we'll see that it only contains the year, 
country and gdpPercap.

This is equivalent to the base R subsetting function that you may have noticed 
before:

```{r}
year_country_gdp_base <- gap[,c("year", "country", "gdpPercap")]
head(year_country_gdp_base)
```

We can even check that these two data frames are equivalent:

```{r}
# checking equivalence: TRUE indicates an exact match between these objects
all.equal(year_country_gdp_dplyr, year_country_gdp_base)
```

Let's take a look at the help documentation for select:

```{r}
?select
```

The arguments for select are:

* `.data` this is a data frame, and this is always the first argument for all 
  tidyverse data frame manipulation functions/
* `...` this is a place holder for any number of other arguments that can 
  optionally be passed on. `select` is expecting the names (unquoted) of the 
  columns you would like to keep or extract.


## `dplyr::filter`

Now let's say we're only interested in African countries. We can use `filter` 
to select only the rows where `continent` is `Africa`.

```{r}
gap_africa <- filter(gap, continent == "Africa")
head(gap_africa, 15)
```

`filter` works on *rows* while `select` works on *columns*

`filter` expects a logical expression, and will *keep* all rows where that logical expression evaluates as `TRUE`.

```{r}
nrow(gap)                     # whole
nrow(year_country_gdp_dplyr)  # select
nrow(gap_africa)              # filter
ncol(gap)                     # whole
ncol(year_country_gdp_dplyr)  # select
ncol(gap_africa)              # filter
```

# Combining dplyr operations

What if we wanted only the country, year and gdp of African countries?

```{r}
gap_africa <- filter(gap, continent == "Africa")
africa_country_year_gdp <- select(gap_africa, country, year, gdpPercap)

head(africa_country_year_gdp)
```

That's not bad, but if we needed to do many different types of data 
manipulations on one data frame, it can get confusing keeping track of all the 
different "intermediate" data frames:

# Piping with `dplyr`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "img", "magrittr_hex.png"), dpi = 400)

```
Above, we used what's called "normal" grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` lie 
in combining several functions using *pipes*.

Pipes take the input on the left side of the `%>%` symbol and pass it in as the 
first argument to the function on the right side. This is why `dplyr` data 
manipulation functions take `.data` as their first argument!

coffee beans %>% 
  harvest() %>% 
  roast() %>% 
  grind() %>% 
  add("hot water") %>% 
  filter() %>% 
  drink().

Since the pipe grammar is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's 
repeat what we've done above using pipes.

```{r}
africa_country_year_gdp_piped <- gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Africa" & year == 1957) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)
head(africa_country_year_gdp_piped, 15)
```


First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on to the next step using 
the pipe symbol `%>%`

The second steps is the `filter()` function. Then, we take that output and send 
it to `select`.

In this case we don't specify which data object we use in the call to 
`select()` or to `filter()` since we've piped it in.

```{r}
identical(africa_country_year_gdp_piped, africa_country_year_gdp)
```

**Aside**: There is a good chance you have encountered pipes before in the 
shell/terminal. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the shell it is `|.` 
But the concept is the same!

# `dplyr::arrange`

Often you may want to re-order data to quickly see what the smallest or largest 
values of a column are. You can do this interactively using `View()`. dplyr also 
has a function for doing this programmatically using `arrange`. 

For example, let's reorder the rows of `gap` by population:

```{r}
gap %>%
  arrange(pop) %>%
  head()

```
By default, `arrange` orders from lowest to highest. We can use `desc` to order it in reverse.
```{r}
gap %>%
  arrange(desc(pop)) %>%
  head()

```
 `arrange` also allows specification of multiple columns:
```{r}
gap %>%
  arrange(year, desc(pop)) %>%
  head()
```

# Breakout

### `dplyr`

1. Use `dplyr` to create a data frame containing data from before 1975 with every column except `continent`.

```{r}

```

2. How many countries had a life expectancy greater than 60 in the year 1982?

```{r}


```

3. Use `dplyr` and `grepl()` to filter for countries with the letter "z" in their name.

```{r}


```

4. Use `dplyr` to sort the gap data set in reverse alphabetical order.

```{r}


```
