# Overview & Recap

So far, we've used `dplyr` to look at particular subsets of our data:

* `filter` to extract the desired rows
* `select` to extract the desired columns

But often, we want to perform calculations with our data, either for every item 
in a data frame (ex: GDP from dollars to Euros) or across parts of our data 
(ex: average GDP per continent). For operations like these, we will use:

* `group_by` to perform operations on a per-group basis (ex: continent)
* `mutate` to calculate a new value and save it to each row
* `summarize` to calculate a new value and save it on a 'per group' basis.

# `dplyr` split-apply-combine

Here's a small data frame to help illustrate:

```{r}
tiny_df <- data.frame(
  x = c('a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c'),
  y = c(2, 4, 0, 5, 5, 10)
)

tiny_df
```

Let's say we wanted to know the average value of y for each value of x. Because 
its quite a small data frame, we can look at it and see that the answer is 
3, 2.5 and 7.5. Or, in a data frame, the answer is:

```{r}
tiny_df_avg <- data.frame(
  x = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
  y = c(3, 2.5, 7.5)
)
tiny_df_avg

```

What we're doing 'in our heads' is looking for a value of x, and then for each of those rows, calculating the value of y. Then, putting it back toegther in a new data frame.

The abstract problem we're encountering here is know as "split-apply-combine":

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "img", "splitapply.png"), dpi = 400)
```

We want to *split* our data into groups (in this case continents), *apply* some 
calculations on each group, then  *combine* the results together afterwards.

If you had to do this all using what we know so far in R, maybe you'd write 
something like this:

```{r}
tiny_df_avg <- data.frame(
  x = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
  y = c(filter(tiny_df, x == 'a')[['y']] %>% mean(),
  filter(tiny_df, x == 'b')[['y']] %>% mean(),
  filter(tiny_df, x == 'c')[['y']] %>% mean())
)

tiny_df_avg 
```

Luckily, `dplyr` offers a clean, straight-forward solution to this problem.

# `dplyr::group_by`

We've already seen how `filter()` can help us select observations that meet 
certain criteria (in the above: `continent == "Europe"`). More helpful, however, 
is the `group_by()` function, which will essentially use every unique criteria 
that we could have used in `filter()`.

A `grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list` is a 
`data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular 
value `continent` (at least in the example above).
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "img", "dplyr-fig2.png"), dpi = 400)
```

```{r}
grouped_gap <- gap %>%
  group_by(continent)

head(grouped_gap)
```

A grouped data frame doesn't look any different (it won't change the order of 
the rows, for example), but R will remember that you've asked it to think of the 
data frame as multiple smaller dataframes:


```{r}

'grouped_df' %in% class(grouped_gap)
'grouped_df' %in% class(gap)

identical(gap, grouped_gap)
```

You can always undo a grouping with `ungroup()`:

```{r}
ungrouped_grouped_gap <- grouped_gap %>%
  ungroup()

'grouped_df' %in% class(ungrouped_grouped_gap)
```

# `dplyr::summarize`

`group_by()` on its own is not particularly interesting. It's much more exciting 
used in conjunction with the `summarize()` function.

This will allow use to create new variable(s) by applying transformations to 
variables in each of the continent-specific data frames.

In other words, using the `group_by()` function, we split our original dataframe 
into multiple pieces, which we then apply summary functions to (e.g. `mean()` or 
`sd()`) within `summarize()`.

The output is a new data frame reduced in size, with one row per group.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents)
```


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "img", "dplyr-fig3.png"), dpi = 400)
```

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent. But it gets even better -- the function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents_byyear)
```

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarize()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gap %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
    median_gdpPrecep = median(gdpPercap),
    mean_pop = mean(pop),
    sd_pop = sd(pop)
  )
head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)

summary(gap)

```

# `dplyr::mutate`

What if we wanted to add these values to our original data frame instead of creating a new object? For this, we can use the `mutate()` function, which is similar to `summarize()` except it creates new variables in the same data frame that you pass into it.

```{r}
gap_with_extra_vars <- gap %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  mutate(
    mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
    mean_pop = mean(pop),
    sd_pop = sd(pop)
  )
head(gap_with_extra_vars)

nrow(gap)                             # where we started
nrow(gap_with_extra_vars)             # using `mutate`
nrow(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)     # using `summarize`
```

# `mutate` vs. `summarize`

It can be confusing to decide whether to use `mutate` or `summarize`. The key 
distinction is whether you want the output to have one row for each group or one 
row for each row in the original data frame:

  - `mutate`: creates new columns with as many rows as the original data frame
  - `summarize`: creates a dataframe with as many rows as groups

Note that if you use an aggregation function such as `mean()` within `mutate()`
without using `group_by()`, you'll simply do the summary over all the rows of the 
input dataframe (as if your grouping variable was "everything").

```{r}
gap %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country))
```

```{r}
lifeExpectancy1952 <- gap %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  select(-pop, - gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) 

head(lifeExpectancy1952)

```

And if you use an aggregation function such as `mean()` within `summarize()` 
without using `group_by()`, you'll simply create an output dataframe with one 
row (i.e., the whole input dataframe is a single group).

```{r}
lifeExpectancy1952 <- gap %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  select(-pop, - gdpPercap) %>%
  summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp))
  

head(lifeExpectancy1952)

```

# `mutate` for adding new columns or modifying existing columns

In general, if you need to add a new column or change an existing column, you 
will use `mutate`.

```{r}
# Adding a column based on a summary statistic we calculated:
 gap %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  select(-pop, - gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  mutate(normalize_life_exp = lifeExp/mean_life_exp) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
# Converting currency within one column
conversion_rate <- 1.19

gap %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_euros = conversion_rate * gdpPercap) %>%
  head()
 
 
 # or, assigning a single value to a new column:
 
gap %>%
  mutate(
    conversion = 1.19,
    gdpPercap = gdpPercap * conversion
  ) %>%
  head(20)
```


# Breakout


1. Use `dplyr` to create a data frame containing the median `lifeExp` for each 
continent.

```{r}


```

2. Use `dplyr` to add a column to the gapminder dataset that contains the total 
population of the continent of each observation in a given year. For example, 
if the first observation is Afghanistan in 1952, the new column would contain 
the population of Asia in 1952.

```{r}


```

3. Use `dplyr` to add a column called `gdpPercap_diff` that contains the 
difference between the observation's `gdpPercap` and the mean `gdpPercap` of the 
continent in that year. Arrange the dataframe by the column you just created, 
in descending order (so that the relatively richest country/years are listed 
first)

```{r}

```

4. Use `dplyr` to create a data frame counting the number of countries in each 
continent. Hint: the function `n()` might be useful!

```{r}

```

5. Bonus: building from your solution to answer 4, create a data frame counting 
the number of countries in each continent, except now containing only those 
countries that have a higher than average (mean) number of countries.

```{r}

```
