# What is R?

*  R is **Open Source** and **free**!
*  It is a full-featured programming language, in particular a scripting language. 
   + This makes it similar in many ways to MATLAB and Python
*  It can be run interactively or as a batch/background job
*  It is designed by statisticians for statisticians - great at the same sort of tasks as STATA and SAS
*  R is being actively developed with ongoing updates/new releases
*  The community of R users make a bunch of tools available for tasks like:
   + graphing
   + advanced/specialized statistical models
   + making websites
   + writing books
   + making LaTeX documents like this one!
* Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux

## Why should I use R?

* R is widely used (statisticians, scientists, social scientists) and has the widest statistical functionality of any software
* R has tools for pharmacometrics! Examples: 
  + `nlmixr`: nonlinear mixed effects modelling in R 
  + `PKPDsim` ODE solver/concentration time curve simulations
  + `mrgsolve` ODE solver/concentration time curve simulations 
  + `mapbayr` MAP Bayesian estimation of PK parameters
  + `vpc` visual predictive checks of NLMEM/NONMEM results
  + `PKNCA` pharmacokinetic non-compartmental analysis
  + And many, many more tools! Check out more here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Pharmacokinetics.html
* Users add functionality via packages all the time
* R is free and available on all major platforms
  + works well with other collaboration tools like git
* R is very powerful, flexible, and easy to use
* R allows for reproducibility and automating tasks
* R can do essentially anything!
  + For a particularly creative use, check out this repo: github.com/cutterkom/generativeart
* Wide usage helps to improve quality and reduce bugs
* Wide usage means there's a lot of tools available online for help

## Why Should I Not Use R?

* Other software is better than R at various tasks
* The *exact* task you need to do was already solved by someone else in some other language.
* R can be much slower than compiled languages (but is often quite fast with good coding practices!)
* R's packages are only as good as the person who wrote them; no explicit quality control
  + Validation tools to vet package quality exist! Check out: github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric
* R is a sprawling and unstandardized ecosystem
  + conventions can vary between packages
  + over the last ~5 years, increased adoption of "tidy"/"tidyverse" conventions (more about this later!)

## What are my other options? Get me out of here!

* Python
* Matlab/Octave
* Julia (for pharmacometrics, see `pumas`)
* C/C++
* SAS
* Stata
